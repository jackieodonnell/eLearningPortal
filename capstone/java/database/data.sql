Some make a case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals, the states, or other recognized entities. Since the American Civil War, the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance (e.g., the decades immediately following the Civil War) or when states'' rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action, executive prerogative or by a constitutional interpretation by the courts.');

The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those in earlier documents, especially the Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776), as well as the Northwest Ordinance (1787),[1] the English Bill of Rights (1689), and Magna Carta (1215). Largely because of the efforts of Representative James Madison, who studied the deficiencies of the Constitution pointed out by anti-federalists and then crafted a series of corrective proposals, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment on September 25, 1789, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison''s proposal that the proposed amendments be incorporated into the main body of the Constitution (at the relevant articles and sections of the document), they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it.[3] Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution.

The nation underwent several economic and cultural changes as industrialization and the transportation revolution changed the economics of the Northern United States and the Western United States. Immigration also shifted the majority of the population further to the Northern United States and began a mass cultural change in the United States from the 1840s until the 1850s. Industrialization went forward in the Northwestern United States. A rail network and a telegraph network linked the nation economically, opening up new markets. Immigration brought millions of European workers and farmers to the Northern United States. In the Southern United States, planters shifted operations (and slaves) from the poor soils of the Southeastern United States to the rich cotton lands of the Southwestern United States. Issues of slavery in the new territories acquired in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) were temporarily resolved by the Compromise of 1850.

Long portrayed by many historians as a time when vindictive Radical Republicans fastened Black supremacy upon the defeated Confederacy, Reconstruction has since the late 20th century been viewed more sympathetically as a laudable experiment in interracial democracy.

What is important is to be able to identify issues and problems in the past and to analyze the interests, values, perspectives, and points of view of all of those involved.  One should examine the events of the past and think about what led up to them.  What might have been done differently to resolve problems?  What alternative actions might have been taken?  What can we learn about how people made decisions to do the things they did?

Throughout the unit students analyze the evolution of political thought that resulted in the adoption of the Constitution. Students begin their studies by exploring what life would be like without government. Using ideas from the Age of Enlightenment, they apply the natural rights philosophy and the social contract theory to examine the purposes of government and the meaning of a constitutional form of government. Next, students build upon what they learned in elementary school and develop more sophisticated understandings of colonial ideas about government and how the relationship between Great Britain and her colonies changed after the French and Indian War. As students examine the mounting tensions between Great Britain and its colonies, they reconsider concepts such as limited government, liberty under the rule of law (republicanism), and representative government. Using the Declaration of Independence as a touchstone, they examine how ideas from the Age of Enlightenment, the colonists’ experiences with self-government, and the changing interactions with Great Britain resulted in the colonists’ decision to declare independence. After exploring the colonists’ arguments in the Declaration, students learn how to write their own historical argument using evidence to support their assertions. Students then analyze the reasons for the adoption and subsequent failure of the Articles of Confederation. They use primary and secondary sources to examine the issues debated at the Constitutional Convention and analyze how and why the Framers resolved or compromised major concerns. In doing so, students examine the structure and functioning of the United States government under the Constitution through the principles of checks and balances, separation of powers, federalism, limited government, and popular sovereignty. By investigating the branches of government with particular focus on the powers, limits, structure, and function of each, students learn how the Constitution dramatically increased the powers of the central government in comparison to the Articles of Confederation. Students then examine the reasons for the inclusion of the Bill of Rights by exploring the arguments of the Federalists and Anti-Federalists over ratification of the Constitution. This unit sets the foundation for the course as students continue to explore the question: How have critical issues debated at the Constitutional Convention influenced government and policy throughout United States history?');
